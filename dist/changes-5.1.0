Qt 5.1 introduces many new features and improvements as well as bugfixes
over the 5.0.x series. For more details, refer to the online documentation
included in this distribution. The documentation is also available online:

*                   Important Behavior Changes                             *
****************************************************************************

 - A Window declared nested inside another Item or Window automatically
   becomes transient for (centered upon) its parent's window, if x and y
   were not explicitly specified
 - The resources property of Item is now its own property independent
   of QObject. It no longer returns all QObject children, or explicitly
   sets QObject parent. The resources property now behaves as documented.

 - As part of a fix for QTBUG-30555, ListView and GridView properties, such
   as count, which are based off of the data model will no longer update
   immediately if queried. Updates are batched to happen once per frame (or
   when properties are being set).

 - tryCompare now correctly fails when it only gets two parameters

 - If a QObject has a property and a slot (or invokable method) with the same
   name, in QML the previous behavior was to let the property obscure the
   method; from Qt 5.1 things work in the opposite way, that is a property can
   never obscure a method having the same name. This is especially important
   for objects having dynamic properties, such as QQmlPropertyMap. This change
   was a consequence of the fix for QTBUG-29836.

 - QTBUG-30837: The Flickable type no longer fixes up the content area on
   startup to move it inside the viewport.
